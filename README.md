# DSP-Box-Filter-Implementation
Digital Signal Processing, Box Filtering and Separable Filter Implementation

In this project, two different (box filter and separable box filter) filtering algorithms are implemented. These algortihms are tested on lena_grayscale_hq.jpg and the results compared with Opencv(cv.boxfilter) box filter(averaging filter) fuction. Two filtering method gives same results as opencv. But separable filters need less time for filtering.
